# qBittorrent Windows Compilation

Component Used: libtorrent-rasterbar 1.0.11, Boost 1.64, Qt 5.10.1

Tracker Authentication Window is disabled.

If you would like to use qBittorrent Enhanced Edition to block Xunlei, Baidu or other leechers, adding the `ipfilter.dat` to block their Offline Download Servers is also highly recommended.

Start from qBittorrent Enhanced 3.3.16.3 & 4.0.4.4, the binary file will be compiled directly from official repo with no modification because the `Tracker Authentication` window can be manually disabled in the advanced settings.
